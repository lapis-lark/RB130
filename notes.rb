# LESSON !: BLOCK

# CLOSURES (have BINDINGS)
=begin
  CLosures are a general programming concept; the term refers to a chunk of code
  that can be reused and passed around. 

  In Ruby, there are three different types of closures: Proc objects, lambdas, and blocks

  Closures can be particularly handy for passing into methods. They reference their
  surroundings, something known as a BINDING.

  Blocks are ARGUMENTS to method calls, and are therefore passed into the calling method.
